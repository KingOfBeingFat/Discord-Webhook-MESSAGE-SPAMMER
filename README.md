First, Install the requirements by going to the folder with requiremnts text file then continue by doing the command `pip install requirements.txt`

Once downloaded, go to VS code or any IDE you are using, and add the .py Script! and finally execute.

# Turning into .exe
First do `pip install pyinstaller` then in the CMD in the Directory of the .py file do `pyinstaller file_name.py` ofcourse replace file_name with your file name!
If you would like an App icon
do `pyinstaller -i file_name.ico file_name.py` ofcourse replace file_name with your file name!
and for a custom name, do `pyinstaller -n file_name file_name.py` ofcourse replace file_name with your file name!
And combine them for both, like this `pyinstaller -n file_name -i file_name.ico file_name.py` ofcourse replacing file_name with your file name! for the 5th time xD
